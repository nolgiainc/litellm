"""Regression + self-test for the duplicate-key guard on the model-price maps.

Upstream has twice handed us a price map with the same model key written twice
(`gemini-omni-flash-preview` in NOL-79, `jp.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` in
NOL-90). `json.load` keeps the LAST occurrence, so both parsed fine and both
shipped an entry that did not match the one a reader would find first in the
file. `jq empty` -- the only validation the price maps had -- accepts duplicates,
so nothing caught either case.

Two things are pinned here:

1. the tracked price maps carry no duplicate keys, and
2. the guard actually FAILS on a duplicate. A guard that has only ever been
   observed passing is not a guard, so the negative cases are asserted too.
