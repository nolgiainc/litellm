# NOL-519. The create leg prices a restore against Topaz's FREE `POST /video/`
# estimate endpoint.
#
# THE PREVIOUS APPROACH IS NOT TUNABLE, AND WAS REVERTED. It read the quote off
# the job's own status object, where `estimates` appears only once the job
# reaches `preprocessing`. That transition is QUEUE-DEPENDENT, not a fixed cost:
# measured on the live API with identical inputs, one restore reached it in 2.6s
# and the next was still `initializing` at 68s. No window acceptable on a
# customer's create request covers a 68s tail, so the poll captured the quote
# only SOMETIMES while adding ~7s to every create.
#
# Intermittent capture is worse than recording nothing. A partially populated
# COGS ledger looks healthy while understating by an unpredictable amount, and
# it permanently mutes the NOL-535 guard, which fires only when a model has
# NEVER recorded a cost - one lucky capture silences it forever. A clean zero is
# detectable; a partial one is not.
#
# `POST /video/` has none of that timing risk because it prices SUPPLIED
# GEOMETRY rather than a queued job: per Topaz's documentation it "does NOT
# consume credits" and "does NOT start processing", so it is free, synchronous
# and off the queue, and it answers on the first call or not at all. The
# geometry it needs is read from the source bytes this leg has already
# downloaded for the upload PUT, so the quote costs no extra network I/O.
#
# The deadline is short and deliberate: this sits inline on the customer's
# create request, and a slow vendor endpoint must yield "no quote" rather than
# hold the leg open. It is a WALL-CLOCK bound, not just the httpx timeout, which
# applies per socket operation - connect, each redirect and each read are timed
# separately, so a server dribbling one byte inside every read window would keep
# an already-accepted create open indefinitely. Only one attempt is made: a
# deterministic endpoint that failed once will fail again for the same input.
_ESTIMATE_DEADLINE_SECS = 6.0

# Topaz's estimate schema requires a source byte size, but it provably does not
# affect the quote - verified against the live endpoint, where 1MB, 24MB and
# 500MB sources returned an identical cost for the same geometry. The real
# length is sent when known (it always is here, since the bytes are in hand),
# and this is the declared fallback.
